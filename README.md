# hello-world
My first repository. I am a beginner developer and I am enjoying learning everything I can.

I am working on WordPress at the moment, and enjoy coding by hand.
My journey will take me to the top of the WordPress ecosystem.
I spent a few years in college (years ago) learning programming and got away from it to be a truck driver.
And now, I'm disabled so I can't drive professionally anymore. Thank goodness I love to code!
